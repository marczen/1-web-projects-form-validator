# project 1 : Basic Form Validator

## What's this?

- Basic form validation made with HTML + CSS + Vanilla JS.
- It's a part of my effort to get familiar with the web dev (1 of 20)

## What I learned in this project

- CSS
  - use class for styling, id for JS
  - use display: block;
  - parent's position should be set to relative if you're going to position child element absolute
  - google font import by using @import
  - use box-sizing: border-box; (on a global scale \* {})
  - use css variable for easier maintainance
  - difference btw visibility: hidden / display: none
- JS & DOM
  - define what your goal is before writing a function
    - plus, think about the usage of a function. So that you can determine what arguments function needs, how & what to return.
  - parentElement DOM selector (gotta learn more about DOM selectors)
  - CSS & JS are closely related
  - addEventListener on the bottom of the .js
- github & VS Code integration
  - this video was great : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tn58KQvWtU
- VS Code shortcut
  - shift + option + down => paste what you've selected right underneath.
  - cmd + d to select the same thing you selected
